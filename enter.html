        <h1> Enter the LOOΠΔVERSE </h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="lead">The LOOΠΔVERSE is the fictional universe the 12 members of LOOΠΔ live in. Since the lore of the LOONAVERSE can be interpreted in many different ways, many Orbits (fans of  LOOΠΔ) have begun to theorize what the music videos entail, and how each member's story intertwines with each other. I will be doing my best to cover the biggest and most popular theories on the LOOΠΔ music videos and the timeline of events in the LOOΠΔVERSE, in a simple, easy to understand manner. Please understand that I will have to leave out a lot. If you wish to dig deeper into the entity that is the LOOΠΔVERSE, please refer to where I gathered most of my information, the LOOΠΔtheWORLD YouTube and website, the LOOΠΔwiki, and twinfish on YouTube (whose videos, sadly, are now deleted).</p>

      <div class="col-lg-10">
        <h2>Locations</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          <h3>Earth</h3>
          <p> Earth is the first dimension or "plane" of the LOOΠΔVERSE to be introduced. It is very similar to our planet Earth, except this dimension follows the rules of the LOOΠΔVERSE, meaning things like cyborgs, angels, and giant frogs can exist. Inhabitants: Heejin, Hyunjin, Haseul, Yeojin, Vivi (Visitors: Choerry, Jinsoul, Go Won)</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">
              <div class="row m-1">

                </div>
              </div>

          <h3>Cosmos</h3>
          <p>The Cosmos is what we can consider to be the center of the LOOΠΔVERSE. It's between good and evil and can possess both. It also looks the least like our world. The Cosmos follows its own abstract rules. Inhabitants: KimLip, Jinsoul, Choerry (Visitors: Heejin, Hyunjin, Yves, Olivia Hye)</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">
              <div class="row m-1">

              </div>
            </div>


          <h3>Eden</h3>
          <p>Eden is an imitation of Earth, or a mirrored version but with a sinister twist. It can look like earth, but it can also look other-worldly. Inhabitants: Yves, Chuu, Go Won, Olivia Hye (Visitors: Vivi, Choerry, Haseul, Heejin)</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">

        <h2>Members</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          <h3>Heejin</h3>
          <p style="color:DeepPink;"> Color: Bright Pink / Animal: Rabbit </p>
          <p style="color:DeepPink;"> Heejin is “The Creator”, the first member of LOOΠΔ to awake in the LOOΠΔVERSE. Many believe that her ambition in life is to paint the LOOΠΔVERSE in color, in which she enlists the help of her other members. HeeJin is theorized to have "god-like" powers. Since she created the LOOΠΔVERSE in the first place, every member is a fractal of her. She has all of ODD EYE CIRCLE's abilities, she has the ability to control the entire rainbow, where as each individual member only has access to their representative color, and she has the ability to control the world to her desire. With all of this, she has become the unofficial "leader" of the LOOΠΔVERSE. </p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">
              <div class="row m-1">
                <div class="col-lg-4 offset-lg-2">
                  <img src="loona-heejin.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded">
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>



          <h3>Hyunjin</h3>
          <p style="color:Gold;"> Color: Yellow / Animal: Cat </p>
          <p style="color:Gold;"> “The Loyal”; Hyunjin is Heejin’s best friend and she supposedly left ODD EYE CIRCLE to be with her. She is crucial to the LOOΠΔVERSE, as she is one of the three primary colors and it is impossible to make any color without the primary colors.</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">
              <div class="row m-1">
                <div class="col-lg-4 offset-lg-2">
                  <img src="loona-hyunjin.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded">
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>



          <h3>Haseul</h3>
          <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"> Color: Green / Animal: Dove </p>
          <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"> "The Mother" ; Since HaSeul represents the white dove, a symbol of peace, she must choose between peace and harmony or learning the truth about the LOOΠΔVERSE and gaining knowledge. In her solo music video, HaSeul chooses truth, and decides to kill the white dove, or kill the peace.</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">
              <div class="row m-1">
                <div class="col-lg-4 offset-lg-2">

                </div>
              </div>
            </div>




          <h3>Yeojin</h3>
          <p style="color:Orange;">Color: Orange / Animal: Frog </p>
          <p style="color:Orange;">“The Daughter”; Thanks to Haseul (who Yeojin saw as a mother figure), as she learned the truth of the LOOΠΔVERSE, this action caused YeoJin to become lost in the forest, and therefore isn't able to engage with 1/3. Though, the most important relationship we see is between Yeojin and the Frog Prince in Kiss Later. As theorized, the Frog Prince represents Choerry who is trying to get her to sin by kissing the frog, and who is being persuaded by Yves.</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">
              <div class="row m-1">
                <div class="col-lg-4 offset-lg-2">

                </div>
              </div>
            </div>



          <h3>Vivi</h3>
          <p style="color:LightPink;"> Color: Light Pink / Animal: Deer </p>
          <p style="color:LightPink;"> “The Cyborg”; ViVi is one of the purest members of the LOOΠΔVERSE, with her representing light and love. We see her innocence and trustworthiness play against her, though, when she is killed by Yves, after being lured into a date with her. She is then brought back to life as a cyborg by Heejin, and we then see her as an “angel” in the LOOΠΔVERSE, whose purpose is to serve HeeJin as an advisor.</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">
              <div class="row m-1">
                <div class="col-lg-4 offset-lg-2">
                  <img src="loona-vivi.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded">
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>




          <h3>1/3</h3>
          <p>1/3 is the first unit, with four official members, and one unofficial member. Heejin, Hyunjin, Haseul, and Vivi make up the “1” and “3”, while Yeojin is the “/” representing her lost place in the LOOΠΔVERSE. 1/3 is a combination of girls present on planet earth. These girls portray the most realistic and practical sceneries that can easily be found on the streets or in school. 1/3's music presents itself with a soft concept around the theme of love as the members express the innocence and excitement of having a first crush. HeeJin, HyunJin, HaSeul, and ViVi start their stories in France, Japan, Iceland, and Hong Kong to become unified as one.</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">
              <div class="row m-1">

              </div>
            </div>



          <h3>KimLip</h3>
          <p style="color:Red;"> Color: Red / Animal: Owl / Superpower: Super Speed </p>
          <p style="color:Red;"> "The Wise" ; Kim Lip's animal, the owl, represents wisdom and knowledge, which we can also see as her role of leader of ODD EYE CIRCLE. We can also assume that this means she is the leader of the primary colors, and therefore has some control over the other members of OEC. As the leader of ODD EYE CIRCLE, HeeJin must've entrusted Kim Lip with watching over her other members, since HeeJin is on another plane of the LOOΠΔVERSE and therefore can't do it herself.</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">
              <div class="row m-1">
                <div class="col-lg-4 offset-lg-2">

                </div>
              </div>
            </div>



          <h3>Jinsoul</h3>
          <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> Color: Blue (and Black) / Animal: Blue Betta Fish / Superpower: Teleportation </p>
          <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> “The Traitor”; JinSoul can use teleportation, meaning that she can travel to other dimensions of the LOOΠΔVERSE, such as to Earth to meet ViVi in Everyday I Need You and to Eden to meet Olivia Hye in Egoist. She also represents blue, meaning she has the ability to create things out of blue, such as when she helped Kim Lip create Choerry by mixing their colors.</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">
              <div class="row m-1">
                <div class="col-lg-4 offset-lg-2">

                </div>
              </div>
            </div>



          <h3>Choerry</h3>
          <p style="color:BlueViolet;"> Color: Purple / Animal: Fruit Bat / Superpower: Dimensional Travel (Traveling Through the Dimensional Planes) </p>
          <p style="color:BlueViolet;"> “The Mirror”; In the LOOΠΔVERSE, Choerry has the purpose to be the "contrast" to the LOOΠΔ members. Through her power of Dimensional Travel, it is theorized that she can visit Earth or Eden as she pleases, which makes sense since she is seen throughout the LOOΠΔ music videos, in Kiss Later and in One&Only.</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">
              <div class="row m-1">
                <div class="col-lg-4 offset-lg-2">

              </div>
            </div>


          <h3>ODD EYE CIRCLE</h3>
          <p>We can see ODD EYE CIRCLE as the primary colors, with three existing members (KimLip, Jinsoul, and Choerry) and one former member (Hyunjin). They are in the Cosmos, an area between light and darkness, and therefore interact with both. They're the ones who helped HeeJin to create the LOOΠΔVERSE and the members who helped her create the other girls. And with their superpowers, they are tasked with finding and uniting all of the members of the LOOΠΔVERSE.</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">
              <div class="row m-1">

              </div>
            </div>

          <h3>Yves</h3>
          <p style="color:Maroon;"> Color: Burgundy / Animal: Swan / Fruit: Apple </p>
          <p style="color:Maroon;">"The Trickster" ; Yves represents cunning and deception in the LOOΠΔVERSE, and is a combination of the most destructive traits of Olivia and HeeJin. She is believed to be trying to lure everyone in the LOOΠΔVERSE to sin and to go against HeeJin. She probably wants to be a creator like HeeJin, but wants destruction and chaos like Olivia, being deemed the technical "villain" in the LOOΠΔVERSE. Olivia just wanted freedom from HeeJin and wanted a friendship like 1/3, but Yves is the one who plots to kill other members and get them to sin.</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">

          <h3>Chuu</h3>
          <p style="color:MistyRose;"> Color: Peach / Animal: Penguin / Fruit: Strawberry </p>
          <p style="color:MistyRose;">“The Lover”; Chuu has a love-like attraction to Yves that causes her to follow Yves blindly and willingly. Chuu spends most of her life trying to be like Yves, imitating and stalking her, but in her dream (end of Heart Attack, which reveals what she truly wants) she just wants to be with Yves. She's able to find a sense of her own identity, realizing that what she feels for Yves is love, rather than envy or a desire to be exactly the same.</p>

            </div>

          <h3>Go Won</h3>
          <p style="color:Aquamarine;"> Color: Mint / Animal: Butterfly / Fruit: Pineapple </p>
          <p style="color:Aquamarine;">“The Princess”; GoWon is the main resident of Eden; her job in Eden is to watch over Yves, Chuu, and, eventually, Olivia Hye. She was tasked ( supposedly by Heejin) to keep everything in order, but she soon comes to seek acceptance from Yves and Chuu. As Yves persuades Chuu to sin, she becomes intrigued as well. She’s lived her life being the good one, the one who always enforced rules, now she sees how that doesn’t make her happy. She realizes that if she also rebels and eats her fruit, she will be happy and not stuck in Eden and will have gained friends.</p>
            <div class="container mb-5 mt-3">
              <div class="row m-1">

              </div>
            </div>

          <h3>Olivia Hye</h3>
          <p style="color:SlateGray;"> Color: Grey / Animal: Wolf / Fruit: Blood Plum </p>
          <p style="color:SlateGray;">“The Fallen Angel”; Olivia Hye is meant to represent destruction and chaos, which can also be confirmed by her representative color, silver - once being bright and colorful, but somehow became tainted and was outcasted. And with HeeJin representing the creator of the universe, this would mean they are on two opposite sides of the same coin, like light and day. One theory is that Olivia created yyxy to mirror ⅓. And, as seen in Egoist, she feels hurt, betrayed, and sick and tired of being pushed around by yyxy, and decides to defy them. She meets Heejin in the end, which could show her wish to live in peace and harmony.</p>

            </div>

          <h3>yyxy</h3>
          <p>youth-youth-by-young are the mirror image to 1/3. They represent the darkness in the LOOΠΔVERSE and tell the story of Adam and Eve, with each member eating their representative fruits and being outcasted by the rest of LOOΠΔ. They represent youth and the naivety and boldness of youth.</p>

        <h3>The Möbius Strip and Color Theory</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          The möbius strip is one of the most complex and detailed parts of the LOOΠΔVERSE. It is critical in order to understand how the LOONAVERSE functions.
<br>
          What is the Möbius Strip Theory? A möbius strip is when a single plane is twisted and connected to itself. To make it more simple, think of a strip of paper. You have two ends of the strip of paper. you can connect the two ends to make a loop. Or you can twist the paper and then connect the two ends. Though it may not seem like much, but, by connecting the two ends of the strip of paper with a single twist in it, you have created a single-sided paper. If you were to draw a picture of a möbius strip, you'd give it three sides. One side in the back, one in the front, and another where the twist occurs. These are the dimensions in the LOOΠΔVERSE. But as you'd probably notice, it's still a piece of paper. And paper has two sides, which is why each dimension of the LOOΠΔVERSE has two sides, a light and a dark side. And it's also important to mention that the dark side mirrors the light side, meaning everything is flipped. The members of the LOOΠΔVERSE don’t live on the möbius strip, instead, the möbius strip applies to the three different dimensions of the LOOΠΔVERSE, that being Earth , the Cosmos, and Eden.
	<br>
          With the use of a color wheel, we can make connections between the members of LOOΠΔ. By incorporating the music videos and the möbius strip, this theory has become the basis of most LOOΠΔ theories.
