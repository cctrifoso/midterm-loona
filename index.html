        <h3>Butterfly</h3>
        <p class="lead">Released on February 19, 2019, the title track ‘Butterfly’ contains LOOΠΔ’s irreplaceable unique concepts. Mixing softness with dynamics, the track takes LOOΠΔ to another level with new beats and drops never heard in K-pop, along with electronic sounds and melody. Under the slogan of ‘For All LOOΠΔs Around the World,’ it spread worldwide; LOOΠΔ causes a Butterfly effect through music for the listeners to gain courage, find oneself, and raise one’s voice. Anyone under influence, is another LOOΠΔ.</p>

        <h3>So What</h3>
        <p class="lead">Recently, on February 5, 2020, LOOΠΔ released [#] their third comeback. Title track 'So What' is an urban dance track, with massive bass and signature horn stabs leaving strong impressions. It is a track that maximizes the “girl crush” feel that LOOΠΔ has not shown off collectively in the past. With the message “break the boundaries that the world has made” LOOΠΔ once again is encouraging listeners to be themselves and to have the courage to speak out.</p>
